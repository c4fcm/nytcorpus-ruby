A ruby parser for the New York Times Corpus.

To run the utility which aggregates data from files, the command is:
  ruby utilities/aggregate_data_from_files.rb <DATADIR>

Working with the raw data files is time-consuming, so we have a script that generates a summary CSV.  This CSV contains a row for each article, with a column for each piece of metadata we care about.  To generate a CSV for a set of files:
  ruby utilties/write_metadata_csv_from_files.rb <DATADIR> <OUTPUT_CSV>

Once you have a summary CSV, you run a script to create a whole bunch of CSV that describe the frequency of values in each piece of metadata:
  ruby utilities/write_counts_csv_from_csv.rb <SUMMARY_CSV> <OUTPUT_CSV_PREFIX>

To run a test, the command is:
  ruby -Itest test/unit/article_test.rb
